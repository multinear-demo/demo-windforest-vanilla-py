# Generating a Complex Mock Database for AI Text-to-SQL Testing

## Introduction

In the realm of database-driven applications, the **Northwind** database has long been a staple for learning and testing. It provides a complex yet understandable environment that mirrors real-world business operations. However, we sought to create our own version â€” a database that emulates the complexities of Northwind without directly copying it. This document outlines the rationale, design, and implementation details of our custom database, which serves as an excellent testing ground for AI-powered text-to-SQL solutions.

## Rationale Behind the Custom Database

The primary goal was to build a comprehensive database that:

- **Reflects Real-World Business Complexities**: Mimicking an actual business environment with relevant entities and relationships.
- **Avoids Legal Issues**: By creating our own data generation logic and structure, we steer clear of any legal concerns associated with using the Northwind database.
- **Facilitates AI Text-to-SQL Testing**: Providing a robust dataset that challenges AI models to generate accurate SQL queries from natural language.

## Overview of the Database Structure
